I embarked on a comprehensive project in the domain of programming compilers, encompassing all stages of code generation. The development process included rigorous work on lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation. Within this project, I successfully implemented a translator capable of handling a diverse set of programming constructs.

The translator demonstrated proficiency in processing arrays, functions, and various types of loops, including 'for,' 'while,' 'do-while,' and 'foreach.' Additionally, I implemented the translation of conditional statements, including 'if' and 'if-else,' incorporating lazy evaluation for enhanced efficiency.

Furthermore, the system exhibited competence in managing classes and inheritance, static variables, and namespaces. Each stage of the compiler, from lexical analysis to the final code generation, was meticulously designed and implemented to ensure the accurate translation of source code into executable instructions.

This project not only showcased a deep understanding of compiler design principles but also highlighted the ability to handle a wide range of programming constructs, including intricate conditional statements with lazy evaluation, contributing to a robust and functionally rich translator.
